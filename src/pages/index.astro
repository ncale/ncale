        I&apos;m an amateur programmer, entrepreneur, internet enthusiast, 
        reader, and aspiring writer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in giving people more sovereignty, and think developing better
        internet infrastructure and privacy technology is the surest way to 
        accomplish that. In sight of this, I enjoy working on and alongside 
        open source, built-to-last, and simple protocols and systems.
