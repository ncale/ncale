[DRAFT]

The goal of this page is to create a practical guide to improving recollection and retention of learned concepts.

### Growth Mindset & Metacognition

Learning, as an active method of molding neural pathways, requires an effortful exploration of one's brain. There are two prerequisites though:

1. motivation to learn, and
2. belief it is possible

Lacking either can lead to a lack in perseverance required to make meaningful changes.

> Metacognition: awareness or analysis of one's own learning or thinking processes [4](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/metacognition)

This boils down to metacognitive strategies—monitoring your learning—being important in helping you make adjustments in your learning process (noticing your deficiencies, what is and isn't working, etc.).

### Spaced Repetition

Spacing study sessions improves recall. Repeated exposure at increasing intervals counteracts the “forgetting curve.” Tools like Anki automate these intervals. Start by reviewing material after a short gap, then gradually lengthen intervals.

### Retrieval Practice

Self-testing cements knowledge (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006). Actively recalling information—without looking at notes—forces the brain to reconstruct knowledge, deepening retention (Karpicke, 2017). Practice with flashcards, quizzes, or problem sets.

(Elaboration & Summarization is similar)

Explaining material in your own words or summarizing it refines understanding. Elaboration prompts you to connect new information to existing knowledge (Chi, 2009). Summaries ensure concise, structured representations of complex topics (Fiorella & Mayer, 2015).

### Interleaving

Mix topics or problem types within a single study session. This disrupts the mindless repetition of one type of problem and encourages adaptive, flexible thinking (Rohrer, 2012). For instance, study math by tackling different formula applications in a varied sequence.

### Chunking & Mnemonics

Grouping data into meaningful chunks frees working memory (Miller, 1956). Acronyms, images, and other mnemonic devices anchor the knowledge (Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968). Break large concepts into digestible segments for deeper comprehension.
