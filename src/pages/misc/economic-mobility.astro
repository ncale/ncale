    <H1>On Upward Economic Mobility</H1>
    <p>
      The American dream has traditionally been known for many things, but foremost, the ability to improve your
      economic and social status. How you accomplish that is a different matter, the point is this is taken for granted
      today--this has rarely been an opportunity for people throughout history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Americans that are the first to attend college in their family are often earn 1.5x to double what their parents
      did.

    <H2>How?</H2>
    <p>
      Throughout history, the primary drivers that would move a person up the ladder was better education and
      entrpreneurship.

    <H2>Today</H2>
    <p>
      Despite what we hear on the news, there are opportunities for economic mobility at the time of writing of the same
      nature as have been available for the past 150 years, although for the first time in human history, we face a tech
      advancement that not only poses a threat to current industries in which people find economic stability, but to
      tech advancement and development itself, which are the very drivers of economic advancement.
    </p>
    <H2>AGI</H2>
    <p>
      AI agents (which are essentially flagship LLMs empowered with the ability to execute in a given environment) and
      their not-far-off, much scarier, younger and more advanced brother, AGI,
    </p>
    <p>
      If AI advances to the point where this is possible, which somehow seems both completely baffling yet reasonable,
      the ensuing story writes itself. Super-abundant intelligence sits in the hands of a select few powerful and
      wealthy people. The value of human capital is greatly diminished. Resources gradually centralize around the owners
      of the abundant intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brings up some other interesting questions. For one, if our timelines for AGI are correct, we're much closer
      to dis-employing the white-collar workers of the world than we are the blue-collared ones (although, robotics is
      not far behind). If something like a UBI is employed to prevent a fall into disorder, how do we nurture the
      unemployed 50% while the remaining 50% are still needed to work?
    </p>
    <aside>
      In addition to the question of economic mobility post-human-usefulness, there are a great many dangers to the
      human race, including the possible and inevitable rapid development of WMDs, misalignment, and more. I would read
      [situational awareness], a series of essays about the major threats related to the development of AGI, to get a
      better grasp of what is in the realm of possibility.
    </aside>
    <H2>What to do?</H2>
    <p>
      If you take the threat of AI seriously, it can be hard to motivate yourself to do anything. One widely employed
      strategy is to dismiss the danger and pretend AGI speculation is a lie created to pump shareholder optimism.
      Another is to wait and hope either that is true or that things end up okay. The most pragmatic solutions I've
      found, both coming from Gwern Branwen, both include writing. The first is related to developing projects-which in
      the case of this article, would be developing a business-would be to write a detailed and exhaustive list of
      instructions for how to build your business, rather than building it, and waiting for AI to advance enough for you
      to pass the instructions along for it to execute for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second includes writing for the sake of writing, which can either prepare you for the future of "engineering"
      by developing your skills in instruction, and by providing a corpus of information that will train and inform how
      the AIs will behave. I've never heard a more convincing way to put it.
