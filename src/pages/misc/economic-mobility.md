The American dream has traditionally been known for many things, but foremost, the ability to improve your
economic and social status. How you accomplish that is a different matter, the point is this is taken for granted
today--this has rarely been an opportunity for people throughout history.

Americans that are the first to attend college in their family are often earn 1.5x to double what their parents
did.

## A Brief History

The first time there was a noticable class divide (READ)

## How?

Throughout history, the primary drivers that would move a person up the ladder was better education and
entrpreneurship.

## Today

Despite what we hear on the news, there are opportunities for economic mobility at the time of writing of the same
nature as have been available for the past 150 years, although for the first time in human history, we face a tech
advancement that not only poses a threat to current industries in which people find economic stability, but to
tech advancement and development itself, which are the very drivers of economic advancement.

### AGI

AI agents (which are essentially flagship LLMs empowered with the ability to execute in a given environment) and
their not-far-off, much scarier, younger and more advanced brother, AGI,

If AI advances to the point where this is possible, which somehow seems both completely baffling yet reasonable,
the ensuing story writes itself. Super-abundant intelligence sits in the hands of a select few powerful and
wealthy people. The value of human capital is greatly diminished. Resources gradually centralize around the owners
of the abundant intelligence.

This brings up some other interesting questions. For one, if our timelines for AGI are correct, we're much closer
to dis-employing the white-collar workers of the world than we are the blue-collared ones (although, robotics is
not far behind). If something like a UBI is employed to prevent a fall into disorder, how do we nurture the
unemployed 50% while the remaining 50% are still needed to work?

In addition to the question of economic mobility post-human-usefulness, there are a great many dangers to the
human race, including the possible and inevitable rapid development of WMDs, misalignment, and more. I would read
[situational awareness], a series of essays about the major threats related to the development of AGI, to get a
better grasp of what is in the realm of possibility.

### What to do?

If you take the threat of AI seriously, it can be hard to motivate yourself to do anything. One widely employed
strategy is to dismiss the danger and pretend AGI speculation is a lie created to pump shareholder optimism.
Another is to wait and hope either that is true or that things end up okay. The most pragmatic solutions I've
found, both coming from Gwern Branwen, both include writing. The first is related to developing projects-which in
the case of this article, would be developing a business-would be to write a detailed and exhaustive list of
instructions for how to build your business, rather than building it, and waiting for AI to advance enough for you
to pass the instructions along for it to execute for you.

The second includes writing for the sake of writing, which can either prepare you for the future of "engineering"
by developing your skills in instruction, and by providing a corpus of information that will train and inform how
the AIs will behave. I've never heard a more convincing way to put it.
