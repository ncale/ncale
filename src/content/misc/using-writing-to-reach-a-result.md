I wanted to dedicate some time to deciphering a comment left on a Terrence Tao (TT) post called '[Maximising the results-to-effort ratio](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/maximising-the-results-to-effort-ratio/)'.

The original article argued for taking low-hanging fruit in terms of illustrating natural consequences, counter-examples, and variations derived from ones main argument in math research papers, as these consequences aren't publishable in their own right since they're too similar to your work, and you're leaving work, however small, to be rederived by readers at a later date (either in their head, or in writing when extending your work), rather than explicitly spelling it out for them. The comment addressing the post is as follows:

> This is like the space-time tradeoff in computer science. A paper is like a program. A user uses the paper to reach a result, just like a program uses an algorithm to reach a result.

> If the paper is too long, exhausting all extensions, it takes up too much space to reach a slight decrease in time, which the reader might be better off rederiving the extensions it themselves. And similarly in the opposite direction.

The [space-time tradeoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space%E2%80%93time_tradeoff) in computer science describes a situation where lowering the time required to accomplish some goal requires using more memory, and vice versa. The anonymous user is likening a person to a computer and a paper to a program in that both are 'run' to reach some result. In the case of the paper, it is to reach an argument's conclusion, and in the case of the program, it is to generate some output.

Papers with many arguments, extensions, and natural following conclusions use a lot of memory, which increases the time required to reach a final understanding. In this case, it may be better to have fewer arguments, explore fewer extensions, and thus reduce the amount of memory required, to decrease the time needed properly absorb.

Put simply, this is a very straightforward relationship and writing rule: increasing your complexity increases the mental burden of your reader, but delivers more results to build from in exchange.

With regard to math papers, TT's suggestion to \\/ thoroughness is of utmost importance, which makes sense. Math is an extremely rigorous domain where all stones must be overturned. "Logical statements that seem like they follow" (<- rewrite) have many hidden assumptions, and explicitly stating points that extend from an argument can help readers reach points they wouldn't otherwise.

There are always hidden assumptions and conclusions that are left to the reader to fill in. It is up to the writer to decide which to state explicitly on their way to reaching a conclusion. Obviously, your level of rigor depends on many things, most importantly, your topic and your reader.
