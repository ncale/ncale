Reading consistently can be a difficult habit to accrue, especially when addicted to brainrot and generally attention challenged, but small changes can make meaningful differences. I'm actively trying this system out but have found success with it so far.

#### 1. Reduce Mindless Screen-time

> **Lemma:** the vast majority of mindless screen time comes from addictive patterns built into phone-based apps

> **Lemma:** quality attention is a limited resource

Great apps are addiction algorithms. Symbiotic apps tend work with their users in a way that builds both parties up, while parasitic ones squeeze something from their users, often even with users acknowledging a discomfort with the amount of time they spend there. Screentime features are common, but good screentime features should do what they can not just to put strict limitations in place, but also to guide behavior (think of electric fence dog-collars - encourage behavior with reinforcement rather than punishment (this is contradictory)).

To help with this, I use an app called [ScreenZen](https://www.screenzen.co/) for the iPhone to restrict some of my social media app usage in a neutral way. I'd recommend trying it out if you have an iPhone.

#### 2. Accumulate Content

Next, identify the things you're interested in reading about, and via what medium. In my case, strictly relating to what I've focused on using this system:

- Genre: Tech
- Sub-genre: AI, digital ownership, software design
- Medium: Videos, essays, blog posts, (and the rare twitter/farcaster post)

Note: reading is usually better for acquiring soft skills, not hard ones, and bringing awareness to something rather than deeply grasping it. Deeply learning requires a grasping of concepts that requires more than just reading. Plan accordingly.

I use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io/) to organize a backlog of resources in categories, with one special category called "to-read-this-week". I set this up because I was finding enough content to read, but I didn't have one medium to disgest everything I saw and produce an opinion on what I felt was most important given my goals. Previously, I would tend to skip things I wanted to read but required a minimal level of mental engagement.

#### 3. Stage Resources to Clear
