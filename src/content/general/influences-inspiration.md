## Influences & Inspiration

My biggest inspiration for creating this website was Gwern Branwen, who is an independent researcher and creator of the website [gwern.net](https://gwern.net/). I first learned about Gwern on twitter from his appearance on the [Dwarkesh podcast](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/), where he was brought on since he [predicted LLM scaling would continue](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/gwern-branwen) as far back as 2020. Outside of his influence strictly relating to his arguments, he's also a clearly inspired writer. A fan of Borges' polymathy, no stranger to deeply esoteric topics from [self experiments with sleep and drugs](https://gwern.net/zeo/zeo) to [meta-science](https://gwern.net/index#meta-science) to [dark-net markets](https://gwern.net/index#dark-net-markets), and having grown up as a [wikipedia editor](https://gwern.net/me#wikis) with thousands of contributions, his writing is like a pragmatic, tech-focused David Foster Wallace.

In addition to Gwern, I've also been influenced by a number writers, including but not limited to the list below.

- Karl Knausgaard (auto-fiction)
- Aldous Huxley (fiction and non-fiction)
- David Foster Wallace (fiction and non-fiction)
- Borges (fiction)
- Tolstoy (fiction)
- Cormac McCarthy (fiction)
