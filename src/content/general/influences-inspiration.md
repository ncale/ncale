## Influences & Inspiration

My biggest inspiration for creating this website was Gwern Branwen, who is an independent researcher and creator of the website [gwern.net](https://gwern.net/). I first learned about Gwern on twitter from his appearance on the [Dwarkesh podcast](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/), where he was brought on since he [predicted LLM scaling would continue](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/gwern-branwen) as far back as 2020. Outside of his influence strictly relating to his arguments, he's also a clearly inspired writer. A fan of Borges' polymathy, no stranger to esoteric topics from [self experiments with sleep and drugs](https://gwern.net/zeo/zeo) to [meta-science](https://gwern.net/index#meta-science) to [dark-net markets](https://gwern.net/index#dark-net-markets), and meticulously citing any and every relevant source ([contributing to wikipedia](https://gwern.net/me#wikis)), his writing is like a pragmatic, tech-focused David Foster Wallace.

In addition to Gwern, I've also been influenced by a number of writers, including but not limited to the list below.

- Karl Knausgaard (see [my struggle 1-6](https://app.thestorygraph.com/series/4129))
- Borges (see [ficciones](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/5f6919dd-25bf-46c6-b2e4-51784e97ad2b))
- Aldous Huxley (see [brave new world](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/8b078331-842c-40ca-a77a-e26e3977ee25))
- Yuval Noah Harari (see [sapiens](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/62e58844-2bdb-4696-b704-581871b472f8))
- Cormac McCarthy (see [outer dark](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c7bc0c15-d1bd-4967-94ea-b7f319101255))
