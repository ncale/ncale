## Influences & Inspiration

My biggest inspiration for creating this website was Gwern Branwen, who is an independent researcher and creator of the website [gwern.net](https://gwern.net/). I first learned about Gwern on twitter from his appearance on the [Dwarkesh podcast](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/), where he was brought on since he [predicted LLM scaling would continue](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/gwern-branwen) as far back as 2020. Outside of his influence strictly relating to his arguments, he's also a clearly inspired writer. A fan of Borges' polymathy, no stranger to deeply esoteric topics from [self experiments with sleep and drugs](https://gwern.net/zeo/zeo) to [meta-science](https://gwern.net/index#meta-science) to [dark-net markets](https://gwern.net/index#dark-net-markets), and having grown up as a [wikipedia editor](https://gwern.net/me#wikis) with thousands of contributions, his writing is like a pragmatic, tech-focused David Foster Wallace.

In addition to Gwern, I've also been influenced by a number of writers, including but not limited to the list below.

- Karl Knausgaard (see my struggle 1-6)
- Aldous Huxley (see brave new world)
- David Foster Wallace (see infinite jest, consider the lobster)
- Borges (see ficciones)
- Yuval Noah Harari (see sapiens)
- Cormac McCarthy (see outer dark)
