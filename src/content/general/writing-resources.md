## Writing Resources

I'm a novice writer and enjoy reading about ways I can improve[^1]. After discovering I had a collection of useful blurbs, I thought I'd list them here as a source of inspiration.

[^1]: Instead of looking to the brilliant writers (whom I enjoy reading) for advice, I usually do better when I listen to experienced bloggers and internet writers.
