## Writing Resources

I'm a novice writer and enjoy reading about ways I can improve[^1]. After discovering I had a collection of useful thoughts, I thought I'd list them here as a source of inspiration.

[^1]: Instead of looking to the brilliant writers (whom I enjoy reading) for advice, I usually gain more when I listen to internet writers and technical folks like [Terence Tao](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/).

#### On Writing

- [Writing, Briefly](https://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html)
- [On Writing](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/)

#### On What to Write About

- [Write down what you've done](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/write-down-what-youve-done/)

#### On Building Arguments

- [Create lemmas](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/create-lemmas/)
