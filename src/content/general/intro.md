I'm a programmer and [indie web](https://indieweb.org/) enthusiast. I write on this website as a learning exercise and tiny body of work.

About me - I work as a full-stack dev at a [crypto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3) startup and my two biggest interests are defi and AI. Sometimes I hack on side-projects.

[Typescript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript) is my language of choice, but dabble with other languages when it makes sense.

<!--
My motivation for creating this site is to

1. provide useful resources for various topics I find important, and
2. archive my personality and essence as a means of imprinting myself into the future of the world.

Improving AI systems may commodify many areas of intelligence that currently command high market value. While Iâ€™m unsure if I'll continue to stay ahead of advanced AI models in the job market, documenting my thoughts may at least be my best way of continuing to be there. Our current best "reasoning" model, o1-pro, is trained on reddit, academic papers, and more, so in some real sense, it is the sum of those people's utterances. I'm not a reddit user, but I do have things I want to write about. So here it is.
