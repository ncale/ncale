I'm a programmer, [indie web](https://indieweb.org/) enthusiast, and part-time writer.

I started my career in business consulting and shifted into web development a year-ish ago. Now I write [typescript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript) for startups, work on small projects in the ethereum ecosystem, and spend the rest of my productive time learning about tech / AI / crypto / software.

My motivation for creating this site is to

1. provide useful resources for various topics I find important, and
2. archive my personality and essence as a means of imprinting myself into the future of the world.

Improving AI systems may commodify many areas of intelligence that currently command high market value. While Iâ€™m unsure if I'll continue to stay ahead of advanced AI models in the job market, documenting my thoughts may at least be my best way of continuing to be there. Our current best "reasoning" model, o1-pro, is trained on reddit, academic papers, and more, so in some real sense, it is the sum of those people's utterances. I'm not a reddit user, but I do have things I want to write about. So here it is.
